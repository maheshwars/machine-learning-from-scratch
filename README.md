# machine-learning-from-scratch
Hands-on Machine Learning from scratch, with notes on important concepts/point discussed in the book "Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch in Python" by Jason Brownlee.

Things Learned:
* How to load and prepare machine learning data ready for modeling.
* How to evaluate predictions made by machine learning models and estimate the skill of models.
* How to estimate a baseline of performance on a problem and compare multiple models on a problem.
* How to implement and apply the Linear regression, Logistic Regression and Perceptron linear machine learning algorithms.
* How to implement and apply the CART, Naive Bayes, KNN, LVQ and Back-propagation nonlinear machine learning algorithms.
* How to implement and apply the Bagging, Random Forest and Stacking ensemble machine learning algorithms.
* How to follow a book and continuously learn concepts from it and making my own notebook with some explanation from the book and some of my own.
